# H3-mart-Assignment
Steps
1. create an upload.js file that converts exel format to json format and inserts documents in mongodb
2. create a model/schema for the creator. 
(Assumption made that from the server side we are updating the price as the price was not given) 
3. created an API for updating product pricing 
4. Also used multer and aws because the image option was available. 
5. We changed the price, so we used Ids as a field for productModel. Otherwise, we could use the JWT library for authentication, where the user would enter his username and password and then request an update. 
6. Finally, the required api was done whereby a user will just request for a price and a json response will be returned.
